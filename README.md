# WF-PPG Preprocessing Code
## Overview
This repository contains example code used for preprocessing the WF-PPG dataset. The WF-PPG dataset, detailed in our main repository and dataset paper, includes PPG signals collected from the wrist (under various contact pressures) and fingertip (ideal contact pressures). This code demonstrates the preprocessing steps we applied to prepare the data for analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `processed/`: Output directory
- `raw_data/`: Raw data files from each device used in the data collection experiment.
- `process.ipynb`: Main notebook for data preprocessing. The notes within document the dataset's preprocessing procedure.
- `p-analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for pressure analysis, result in figures in the paper.
- `classify.py`: A specific file for the classification method described in the paper.
