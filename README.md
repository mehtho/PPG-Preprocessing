# WF-PPG Preprocessing Code
## Overview
This repository contains example code used for preprocessing the WF-PPG dataset. The WF-PPG dataset, detailed in our main repository and dataset paper, includes PPG signals collected from the wrist and fingertip under various contact pressures. This code demonstrates the preprocessing steps we applied to prepare the data for analysis.

## Repository Structure
